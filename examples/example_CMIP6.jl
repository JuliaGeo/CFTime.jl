# This example shows how to use the CFTime package with CMIP6 data
# in the NetCDF format following the CF Conventions.
#
# The CMIP6 example data is from NOAA-GFDL and data extracted at a single point
# as provided by the R package [CFtime](https://github.com/R-CF/CFtime). The
# data is downloaded automatically.
#
# This example can also be downloaded as a Julia source file
# [example_CMIP6.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/CFTime.jl/blob/master/examples/example_CMIP6.jl).
