    AbstractCFDateTime{T,Torigintuple}

Supertype for all DateTime structures following the CF conventions
where the time instance is represented as a duration of type `T` since a time
origin specified by the value type of the tuple `Torigintuple`.

The tuple is composed of the integers representing the year,
month and day as well as smaller time divisions if necessary.

The type parameter `T` and `Torigintuple` are considered as internal API.
Only reducing the number of type parameters of `AbstractCFDateTime` will be
considered as a breaking change.
